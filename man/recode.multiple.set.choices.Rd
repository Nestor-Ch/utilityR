)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe containing records which will be affected.}

\item{variable}{String containing the name of the select_multiple variable.}

\description{
This function affects choice columns: setting 1 for `choices` and 0 everywhere else.
For the cumulative variable, the value will be more or less equal to `paste(choices, collapse=" ")`
(to be precise, the exact order of choices will be the same as the one in `tool.choices`) ...
Additionally, the _other variable will be set to NA if it is not one of the `choices`
}

\dontrun{
